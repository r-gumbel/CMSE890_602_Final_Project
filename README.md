# **CMSE890_602_Final_Project**

## Overview
This project aims to create a workflow to organize and benchmark Hartree-Fock calculations for modeling nuclei in their ground states.  

Or, as I like to call it: _"Was Something Left Undone?"_

## Motivation
<span style="font-size:14px;">
Understanding the dynamics of colliding nuclei—and the wide spectrum of resulting reactions—presents enormous challenges. These include:
</span>

- <span style="font-size:14px;">The complex interplay of two fundamental forces: the Coulomb force and the nuclear strong force.</span>
- <span style="font-size:14px;">Physics problems that are:</span>
  - <span style="font-size:14px;">Analytically intractable,</span>
  - <span style="font-size:14px;">Difficult to calibrate experimentally,</span>
  - <span style="font-size:14px;">Computationally expensive.</span>

## Goals
<span style="font-size:14px;">
- Develop a streamlined and reproducible workflow for Hartree-Fock calculations.
- Benchmark the calculations to ensure accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Why This Matters
<span style="font-size:14px;">
Modeling nuclear interactions accurately has profound implications in areas like nuclear energy, astrophysics, and fundamental particle physics. By creating a structured workflow, we aim to simplify these calculations and make them more accessible to researchers.
