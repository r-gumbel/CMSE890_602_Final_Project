# **CMSE890_602_Final_Project**

## The gist?  To create a workflow that will organize and benchmark Hartree-Fock calculations used to model nuclei in their ground states.

## Or as I like to call it: _'Was Something Left Undone?'_


# Motivation for this project:
    * The task of understanding the dynamics of colliding nuclei--and the wide spectrum of resulting reactions--presents enormous difficulties. The resulting melange of two fundamental forces, i.e. the Coulomb and Nuclear strong forces results in physics problems that are often analytically intractable, difficult to calibrate experimentally, and inordinately computationally expensive.
