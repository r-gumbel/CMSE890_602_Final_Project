This site contains project documentation for the final project of the course `CMSE 890-602: Reproducible Computational Workflows`.  

The project itself uses a melange of tools we learned in the course, with the aim of creating a workflow that will all at once organize, streamline, and benchmark data produced in the initial steps of the nuclear modeling I use in my work as a researcher. With the added hope of making the computational tools potentially more accessible to collaborators--as well as anyone else who might find the very powerful nuclear modeling software helpful for their work.  

## Table of Contents

The information displayed on this website follows the general project documentation organazation principles described by Daniele Procida in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Constructing a Workflow](index.md)
2. [Calculating and Benchmarking](tutorials.md)
3. [Capturing the Physics We Want](how-to-guides.md)
4. [VU-TDHF3D as Applied to Nuclear Structure Calculations](reference.md)
5. [The Snakemake Approach to Organizing Our Workflow](explanation.md)

your use case by looking at the different pages.

I want to thank our course instructor, Dr. Andrew Fullard,
for a great class, full of interesting topics, that he has
a knack for conveying with both clarity and humor.
