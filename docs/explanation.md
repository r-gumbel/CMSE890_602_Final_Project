This part of the project documenation focuses on an
**understanding-oriented** approach.  You'll get a 
chance to read about the background of the project,
as well as reasoning about how it was implemented.

> **Note:** Expand this section by considering the
> following points:

- Give context and background on your library
- Explain why you created it
- Provide multiple examples and approaches of how 
    to work with it
- Help the reader make the connections
- Avoid writing instructions or technical descriptions 
    here (But can I put a DFD or two here?)
