This part of the project documentation focuses on a 
**learning-oriented** approach. The idea is to learn how to get started with the code in this project.

> **Note:**Expand this section by considering
> following points.

- Help newcomers with getting started
- Teach readers about your library by making them write code (Prepare input files?)
- Inspire confidence through examples that work for
    everyone, repeatedly (This could be tricky...will need to be careful with possible issues with the gnu gfortran compiler)
- Give readers an immediate sense of achievement
- Show concrete examples, no abstractions
- Provide the minimum necessary explanation
- Avoid any distractions

Okay.  I need to clarify to myself that the target audience for this workflow is people who are ***already***
adept at using the VU-TDHF3D software (or it's open source cousin Sky3d).  Need to focus for this project, and not get bogged down in the sprawl that comes while scrambling to be everything to everyone.
